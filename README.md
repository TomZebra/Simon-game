Repeat the pattern and test your memory. The object of the game is to remember the previous pattern and repeat it by pressing the buttons. 

## Installation

Just download the files and copy the index.html path from VSCode to your browser address bar.


## Usage

The game will start by selecting a random color, and the players job is to repeat that color. Next round the game will play a random color again but this time player must remember the previous color, press the previous button and then the current one. Each time the player must remember the whole array (the computer only shows color from the next sequence, not the entire sequence so far.)
This game is developet using HTML, css, javascript with jQuerry.
